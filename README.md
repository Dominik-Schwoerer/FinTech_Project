# FinTech Project: Hypothetical Case Study (PostgreSQL)
This FinTech project models the reporting structure for a hypothetical lending company granting 12-months loans with flexible repayment terms. Inspired by real-life job experience and reporting obligations to outside stakeholders, the project covers th following reports:
1. Monthly Sales Performance: How many loans were signed and in which market?
2. Customer Acquisition Metrics: How many loans were signed over which channel?
3. Portolio Performance: How did the portfolio develop month over month? (Measured by portfolio size: loan payouts - loan repayments = outstanding notional)
4. Debt Funding Reporting: Prepare a recurring reporting template based on funding agreement that (i) outlines the portfolio status as per reporting data as well as (ii) details on problematic loans.

Since no comparable dataset was available online, the project is based on ramdomized data. The data sets are available as .csv.
